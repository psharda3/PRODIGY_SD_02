## Guessing Game

This repository contains a C++ program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program prompts the user to input their guess, compares it to the generated number, and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It continues until the user correctly guesses the number and then displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.

### How to Use
1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter your guess.
4. The program will indicate if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Continue guessing until you find the correct number.
6. The program will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.

### Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

### Compiling and Running the Program
To compile and run the program, execute the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
g++ -o guessing_game guessing_game.cpp
./guessing_game
